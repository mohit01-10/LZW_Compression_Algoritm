## Project Description

This project uses Lossless data compression techniques, Huffman Coding Algorithm and LZW Alogrithm to Compress any file format and reduce the size of file efficiently. It can be any file whether JPEGs, PNGs, PDFs, Word files, Excel Files, PPTs, MP3 files, MP4 files, MKV files, JSON Files etc.

## Features
- User Menu Interface
- Any file format can be compressed
- Time taken and size reduced shown by both algorithms

## Instructions on Usage
- Download the project, go to the project directory , install os,time,base64 library and you are good to go.
- Start the program at your IDE's terminal (or command prompt) by executing ```python main.py```
